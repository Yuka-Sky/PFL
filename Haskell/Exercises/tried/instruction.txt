*Basic Arithmetic and Boolean Operations:*
  - `Push Integer`: Pushes a constant integer value onto the stack.
  - `Add`, `Mult`, `Sub`: Arithmetic operations that add, multiply, and subtract the top two elements of the stack.
  - `Tru`, `Fal`: Boolean constants representing true and false.
  - `Equ`: Checks equality between the top two elements of the stack.
  - `Le`: Checks if the top element is less than or equal to the second element of the stack.
  - `And`: Performs a logical AND operation on the top two elements of the stack.
  - `Neg`: Negates the top element of the stack.

*Variable Operations:*
  - `Fetch String`: Pushes the value bound to the given variable name onto the stack.
  - `Store String`: Pops the top element of the stack and updates the state, binding the value to the given variable name.

*Control Flow Operations:*
  - `Noop`: A dummy instruction that doesn't have any effect.
  - `Branch Code Code`: A conditional branch instruction that changes the flow of control based on the top of the stack.
  - `Loop Code Code`: A looping construct used to implement while loops.

The `deriving (Show)` part is a derived instance for the `Show` type class, which allows instances of `Inst` to be displayed as strings for debugging and printing purposes.

In your Haskell code, when you see `Inst` being used, it refers to values of this data type, representing the various instructions that the abstract machine can execute. For example, `Push 42` is an instance of `Inst` that represents the instruction to push the constant `42` onto the stack.
